# Description
**Learning javascript from the internet is tough**. There are many tutorials but little courses that thoroughly teach this very misunderstood language. I'm putting it out there: Javascript is powerful! Javascript is the language of the browser and its here to stay for a good while. 

The best way to learn I've found, is through books. I know, for a web developer that's very unglamorous, but beleive me when I tell you that they'll keep you focused studying and not procrastinating. I highly recommend [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) by Douglas Crockford and [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

These algortihms are essentials that any javascipt developer should be able to do in an interview and cover a great deal of the fundamentals of the language. I will be posting advanced topic projects in AJAX, API's, D3 and NodeJS later.

# Rules
1. Don't type google.com while doing the exercises
2. Don't look at stackoverflow
3. Don't use w3c for explanations
4. Only use [Mozilla's Javascript Developer Portal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for reference
5. Practice makes perfect
